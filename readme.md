You should always test for file upload vulnerabilities by trying to upload simple php shells in target websites.
Common php file extensions:
1. .php
2. .php3
3. .php4
4. .php5
5. .php6
6. .phtml
7. .png.php
8. .jpg.php
9. .jpeg.php


for shell.php above add ?cmd=<command-e.g whoami> in the path where the file is uploaded eg /images/safeImage.php?cmd=whoami
